## Functionalities
- **Input Fields:**
  - The form includes various fields such as title, brand, model, year, color, price, license plate, and RENAVAM.
  - Uses `TextFieldWithLabel` for text input and `SelectWithLabel` for dropdowns.
  - Price field accepts only numeric input.
- **License Plate & RENAVAM Formatting:**
  - The license plate and RENAVAM fields automatically format the input using the `formatLicensePlate` and `formatRenavam` utility functions.
  - The license plate input is restricted to a maximum of 8 characters.

## Structure
- The form is laid out using Material-UI's `Grid` system for a responsive design.
- Each field is placed inside a `Grid` item for easy adjustment across various screen sizes.
- The `Button` component is used for form submission, styled as a contained primary button.

## Code Example
```tsx
<form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
  <Grid container spacing={2}>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
      <TextFieldWithLabel
        name="title"
        label="TÃ­tulo"
        value={formData.title}
        onChange={event => onFormChange('title', event.target.value)}
        required
      />
    </Grid>
